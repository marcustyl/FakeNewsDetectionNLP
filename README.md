# FakeNewsDetectionNLP

This is a Natural Language Processing Project done to determine the level of impact different text processing techniques have towards the accuracy of fake news detection models. Do take note, this is just a prototype project and not a finished product.

For this project, the GloVe Embedding File selected is "glove.6B.100d.text" which is too large to upload into the repo. Hence here is the link to download the relevant file at "https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/"
